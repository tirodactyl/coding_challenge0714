#Coding challenge from Company X

They asked me to post this on Github so I figured I'd make a friendly readme. Maybe somebody else will find this interesting as an example of what you might want to give potential interviewees.

I found this problem to be good for this purpose as it is not overly complex, but requires your candidate to have a good grasp of generic programming principles, OO design principles, TDD, and git is an added bonus. Thanks - I enjoyed this challenge!

##Objective

Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers.
The program must run from the command line and print one table to STDOUT.
The first row and column of the table should have the 10 primes, with each cell containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and column.

Notes

- Consider complexity. How fast does your code run? How does it scale? â€¢ Consider cases where we want N primes.
- Do not use the Prime class from stdlib (write your own code).
- Write tests. Try to demonstrate TDD/BDD.
